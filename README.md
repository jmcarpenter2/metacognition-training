# metacognition-training

This repository contains data and code supporting the following paper:
Carpenter, Sherman, Kievit, Seth, Lau, & Fleming (under review) "Domain-general enhancements of metacognitive ability through adaptive training"

Figures_Main.m will load the behavioural data and generate all the plots from the paper.

In order to produce a single plot, Figure X, one must load the data and then simple run FigureX.m from the Figure_Code folder. Alternatively, one can simply comment out the other Figure functions from Figures_Main.m and run that.

## Folders

_Data_

_Figure Code_

Contains functions to produce each Figure or even part of a Figure separately.

_Figures_ 

Where the outputted figures are stored
